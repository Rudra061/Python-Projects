Title: Flatmates Bill

Description: An App that gets as the input the amount of a bill for a particular period and the days that each of the
             flatmates stayed in the house for that period and returns how much amount each flatmate has to pay. It also
             generates a PDF report staring the name of the flatmate, the period, and how much each of them has to pay.
